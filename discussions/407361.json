    "Html": "\r\n<p>Hi Gil, the reason for this is that FluentData disposes and cleans up the connection etc after the query has been executed. Also it was a simple prevention against supporting the feature you need since it would make the code more complex and require a change\r\n to many methods on the command object.</p>\r\n<p>I've had some others request the same feature, so I will look into it after the vacation to see how much work it is to fix. But for now I suggest you create a method that creates a new command object every time you call it.</p>\r\n<p>Regards,</p>\r\n<p>Lars-Erik</p>\r\n",
