The goal for FluentData is to be a simple and easy to use Micro ORM with good performance, and with a source code that can be easily understood and maintained by the developer who decide to use it. By  using Reflection Emit we would stay true to the performance principle but not to keeping the source code easy to understand and maintain.</p>\n<p>For 99.9% of the applications in the world reflection is not a problem (it's really fast on today's computers) and the time it takes is not something that is noticed by the end users (applications are usually slow due to poor SQL or too many database queries).</p>\n<p>Regards,<br />Lars-Erik Kindblad</p>",
