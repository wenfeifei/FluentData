    "Description": "I've not gone through the code myself, but have looked in the documentation and browsed the API via the Object Browser. I'm looking for a way to specify a longer than normal Command Timeout. Normally I would do this in the DbCommand, but this is not exposed.\nAny way that I'm missing of doing this? Please keep in mind that this is for Sql Server. It does not support setting the Command Timeout via the connection string.",

The other option is to somehow set the timeout on the Query<T>, but that means you have to set it on every query you exexute.\r\nI would prefer the first option.",
