    "Description": "Hello; \nI'm new to using FluentData and working with an existing application that is using it. \n\nWhen I'm trying to build in Visual Studio I first downloaded the dll and added it as a reference. \n\nNow I get the following error: \n'FluentData.IDbCommand' does not contain a definition for 'Query' and no extension method 'Query' accepting a first argument of type 'FluentData.IDbCommand' could be found (are you missing a using directive or an assembly reference?) \n\nThe line of code is as follows:\n                var result = Proxy.Context.Sql(query.ToString()).Query<T>().FirstOrDefault();\n\nI've also tried to delete the reference. Then open NuGet and searched for fluentdata and clicked the install button and I still get the same error. When installed if from NuGet it added the following line of code to the .config file:\n\n  <package id=\"FluentData\" version=\"3.0.0.0\" targetFramework=\"net45\" />\nAny assistance will be greatly appreciated.\n\nAny assistance will be greatly appreciated. \n\nThanks; \nCatto",
